Note:
     
   1. use `-l` to define the saving location path
   2. use of `-u` is necessary
   3. if chapter and range don't run together, if chapter is specified then only 
      that chapeter will be downloaded not the start or end chapter if mentioned
      
ToDo in future:

1. keep the history of downloaded data in the apllication so if the application is stopped in beetween , user able to start download from that point not for the begining.
2. Desktop application (electron js or qt )
